â™Š Gemini Code
Just a little agent that thinks(thinks it's claude code), plans, reads, writes and runs python code using Googleâ€™s Gemini and a few function calls.

Plays well in a controlled sandbox (./calculator directory)

*boot.dev guided, Inspired by the big kids like Claude Code. But hey, this one's got floaties. ðŸ›Ÿ*
